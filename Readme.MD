# Competitive Programming Templates

A collection of my personal competitive programming templates.

## Usage

### For Sublime Text Users:
1. Copy the `.sublime-snippet` files to your `Packages/User` directory
2. Use the tab triggers in your C++ files (e.g., type `segtree` + Tab)

### For Other Editors:
- Copy the part of the code snippets you need

## Status
